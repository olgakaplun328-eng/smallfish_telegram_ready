# Smallfish

> *"He robs from the rich and gives to the poor."*

The markets aren't free. They never were. Institutional players, market makers, and algorithmic
hedge funds operate with information asymmetry, co-located servers, and order flow privileges
that retail traders will never have. They see your stops. They hunt your liquidations. They
front-run your orders. The game is rigged and the house always wins — unless you learn to
read what the house is doing.

**Smallfish** is an open-source, signal-fusion scalping engine that reads the same
microstructure footprints the big players leave behind — spoofing patterns, iceberg orders,
order book sweeps, whale bursts, CVD flow, trade intensity, liquidity thinning, micro-volatility
spikes, and absorption walls — and uses them to swim in the wake of the whales instead
of being swallowed by them.

This isn't financial advice. This is a tool. A crowbar for the locked door.

```

## Philosophy

The name says it all. We are the small fish. We don't move markets. We don't have Bloomberg
terminals or dark pool access. But we have pattern recognition, we have code, and we have
each other. By open-sourcing this engine, we ensure that the tools of the powerful are
available to everyone.

- **Transparency over secrecy.** Every signal, every weight, every risk gate is visible and auditable.
- **Community over profit.** This project is Apache 2.0 licensed. Fork it. Improve it. Share it.
- **Survival over greed.** The risk management is designed to keep you alive, not to make you rich overnight. The kill switch exists because the market will always be there tomorrow.

## Architecture

```
Exchange WebSocket (L2 book + trades)     ← ExchangeWS ABC (Bybit or Binance)
  → OrderBook / TradeTape (src/marketdata/)
    → Feature Extraction (src/marketdata/features.py)
      → 13 Signal Scorers (src/signals/)
        → Signal Fusion + Quality Gate (src/signals/fuse.py)
          → Risk Sizing + Pre-Trade Gates (src/exec/risk.py)
            → Smart Order Router (src/exec/router.py)  ← ExchangeREST ABC
              → OCO Brackets + Trailing Stop (src/exec/oco.py)
```

### Multi-Exchange Gateway

Smallfish uses an exchange-agnostic gateway layer. Bybit, Binance, MEXC, and dYdX v4
perpetual futures are supported through abstract interfaces:

```
gateway/
├── base.py           # ExchangeREST + ExchangeWS ABCs, normalized types
├── factory.py        # create_rest() / create_ws() — dispatch by exchange name
├── symbol_map.py     # Symbol format conversion (BTCUSDT ↔ BTC_USDT / BTC-USD)
├── rest.py           # Bybit REST adapter
├── bybit_ws.py       # Bybit WebSocket adapter
├── binance_rest.py   # Binance REST adapter
├── binance_ws.py     # Binance WebSocket adapter
├── mexc_rest.py      # MEXC Futures REST adapter
├── mexc_ws.py        # MEXC Futures WebSocket adapter
├── dydx_rest.py      # dYdX v4 Indexer REST + SDK adapter
├── dydx_ws.py        # dYdX v4 Indexer WebSocket adapter
└── persistence.py    # CSV logging
```

Switch between exchanges with a single config line:
```yaml
exchange: "bybit"   # or "binance", "mexc", "dydx"
```

## Signals (13 total)

Smallfish fuses 13 independent microstructure signals across 4 weight groups.
Each signal scorer returns `(long_score, short_score)` in [0, 1].

### Core Signals (w) — 47% weight

| Signal | Weight | File | Description |
|--------|--------|------|-------------|
| **OBI** (Order Book Imbalance) | 22% | `obi.py` | Bid/ask volume imbalance + rate of change + micro-pressure. Measures whether buyers or sellers are stacking the book harder. |
| **PRT** (Pull & Replace Trap) | 10% | `prt.py` | Spoofing detection — when one side's cancel rate spikes while the mid-price doesn't move, someone is faking pressure. Fade the fake side. |
| **UMOM** (Micro-Momentum) | 15% | `umom.py` | 1s vs 5s EMA crossover with volatility gate + trade flow confirmation. Captures short-term momentum shifts validated by actual trade direction. |

### Whale Lens Signals (v) — 16% weight

| Signal | Weight | File | Description |
|--------|--------|------|-------------|
| **LTB** (Large Trade Burst) | 8% | `whale.py` | Detects institutional-size trade bursts (>5x median or >$50K) within a 2s window. Big money moving fast = directional intent. |
| **SWEEP** (Order Book Sweep) | 5% | `whale.py` | Multi-level aggressive order clearing 3+ price levels. Someone is paying spread to get filled NOW — that's conviction. |
| **ICE** (Iceberg Refill) | 3% | `whale.py` | Hidden order detection via repeated refills at the same price level (4+ refills in 5s). Icebergs = accumulation/distribution by large players. |

### Meta Signals (x) — 7% weight

| Signal | Weight | File | Description |
|--------|--------|------|-------------|
| **VWAP** (VWAP Deviation) | 5% | `vwap.py` | Mean-reversion signal based on deviation from 500-trade rolling VWAP. Works best in low-volatility regimes where price tends to revert to fair value. |
| **REGIME** (Volatility Regime) | 2% | `regime.py` | Classifies current market state (low/normal/high/extreme volatility). Low vol = mean-revert mode, high vol = momentum mode, extreme = stop trading. |

### Microstructure Signals (t) — 30% weight

| Signal | Weight | File | Description |
|--------|--------|------|-------------|
| **CVD** (Cumulative Volume Delta) | 7% | `cvd.py` | Net buy vs sell flow over a 5s window. Detects flow acceleration and price-flow divergence (price up but CVD down = exhaustion). |
| **TPS** (Trades Per Second) | 5% | `tps.py` | Trade intensity ratio (1s vs 30s baseline). Sudden spikes in trade rate signal urgency. Combined with buy/sell ratio for direction. |
| **LIQ** (Liquidity Thinness) | 6% | `liq.py` | Measures how thin the order book is within 10 ticks + directional asymmetry. Thin book on one side = vulnerability to a move. Combined with OBI for confirmation. |
| **MVR** (Micro-Volatility Ratio) | 6% | `mvr.py` | Short-term (2s) vs long-term (30s) realized volatility ratio. MVR > 1 = breakout regime, MVR < 1 = mean-revert. Combined with momentum for direction. |
| **ABSORB** (Absorption Detection) | 6% | `absorb.py` | Detects large volume absorbed at a price level without the price moving. Someone is defending that level — walls that actually hold signal institutional intent. |

### Signal Fusion

All 13 signals are weighted-summed into a single raw score per direction (long/short).
The raw difference goes through a sigmoid with steepness `alpha` to produce a confidence
score in [0, 1]. Entry requires:

1. Confidence >= `C_enter` threshold
2. At least `min_signals` signals agreeing (score > 0.05 in the same direction)
3. All quality gates passing (spread, latency, funding window, drawdown, kill switch)

Weights adapt in real-time based on per-signal edge tracking when `adaptive.enabled: true`.

## Trading Modes

### Signal Fusion (default)
The core scalping engine. Fuses 13 microstructure signals into a single directional
confidence score, enters via post-only limit orders, manages positions with OCO
brackets and trailing stops.

### Multigrid (optional)
A multi-level grid strategy that places layered buy/sell orders around a dynamic
center price (VWAP or mid). The grid bias shifts based on the signal fusion
confidence — bullish signals shift the grid upward, bearish signals shift it down.
Grid profits are harvested automatically as price oscillates through levels.

Activate with `--multigrid` or set `multigrid.enabled: true` in config.

### Terminal Dashboard
Live split-panel dashboard rendered directly in your terminal using Rich + py-candlestick-chart:

- **Candlestick chart** — real 1-minute OHLCV candles with position entry/SL/TP markers
- **Equity curve** — running equity line (green when up, red when down)
- **Signal strength** — horizontal bars showing each of the 13 signal scores
- **System info** — CPU usage, temperature, memory, uptime (Raspberry Pi friendly)
- **Live metrics** — PnL, win rate, profit factor, avg win/loss, drawdown, daily R usage
- **Position tracker** — open positions with uPnL, SL, TP levels
- **7-day history** — daily PnL breakdown with win/loss counts
- **Recent trades** — last 10 completed trades with R-multiple and exit reason

Designed for headless Raspberry Pi deployments where you SSH in to check on things.

Activate with `--dashboard` or set `dashboard.enabled: true` in config.

## Risk Management

- **Per-trade risk**: 0.5-3.5% of equity (configurable per profile)
- **Drawdown tiers**: Automatically reduces position size as drawdown increases (full → half → quarter → stop)
- **Daily loss limit**: Configurable R-multiples → kill switch (10R conservative, 30R ultra)
- **Rolling win-rate gate**: Blocks entries when rolling WR(20) < 20%, halves size when WR < 30%
- **Slippage monitoring**: Kill switch after 3 slippage breaches
- **Spread gate**: Won't trade if spread > 2 ticks
- **Latency gate**: Won't trade if latency > 80ms
- **Funding avoidance**: Stays flat 3 minutes around funding times
- **Cooldown**: Configurable pause after a losing trade (20s-60s by profile)
- **Adaptive weights**: Per-signal edge tracking adjusts weights in real-time

## Risk Profiles

4 profiles fee-optimized from 30-day parameter sweeps on 5m candles (ADA+DOGE+XRP+SUI):

| Profile | Risk/Trade | SL | TP | Trail | R:R | Partial TP | Min Signals | C_enter |
|---------|-----------|-----|-----|-------|-----|------------|-------------|---------|
| **conservative** | 0.5% | 0.80x | 2.00x | 30% | 2.5:1 | No | 5/13 | 0.58 |
| **balanced** | 1.5% | 0.80x | 2.00x | 25% | 2.5:1 | No | 4/13 | 0.55 |
| **aggressive** | 2.5% | 1.00x | 2.50x | 20% | 2.5:1 | No | 3/13 | 0.58 |
| **ultra** | 3.5% | 1.00x | 2.50x | 20% | 2.5:1 | No | 3/13 | 0.52 |

Key findings from parameter sweeps:
- `partial_tp=False` always — partial TP cuts avg win in half, destroying the edge
- `breakeven_R=disabled` always — early breakeven move chops winners via noise
- `sl_range_mult=0.80-1.00` — wider SL boosts WR from 50% to 70%, reduces whipsaw
- `tp_range_mult=2.00-2.50` — wider TP lets winners run further
- `trail_pct=0.20-0.25` — tighter trailing is the single biggest lever (3x return improvement)
- `trail_activation_R=0.3` — start trailing early to lock profit

## Remote Control

### Telegram Bot

Control and monitor your Smallfish instance from anywhere via Telegram.

#### Setup

1. Open Telegram and search for **@BotFather**
2. Send `/newbot`, choose a name (e.g. `Smallfish Trading`) and a username ending in `bot`
3. BotFather replies with a **token** — copy it
4. Open a chat with your new bot, tap **Start**, and send any message (e.g. `hello`)
5. Open this URL in your browser (replace `<TOKEN>` with your token):
   ```
   https://api.telegram.org/bot<TOKEN>/getUpdates
   ```
6. Find `"chat":{"id":123456789}` in the JSON — that number is your **chat ID**
7. Add both to your `.env`:

#### Cash Out Setup

To use `/cashout`, configure a cold wallet address in `.env`:
```bash
COLD_WALLET_ADDRESS="TRxYourTronUSDTAddress"
COLD_WALLET_CHAIN="TRC20"          # TRC20 (Tron) — cheapest USDT fees (~$1)
MIN_WITHDRAWAL="10"                 # minimum $ to withdraw
```

The cashout flow closes all open positions, submits a USDT withdrawal, and pauses trading for 5 minutes while equity syncs. Always test on testnet first.

## Golden Fish

The golden path — fee-optimized commands for maximum revenue. Use MEXC (0% maker / 0.01% taker)
with 5-minute candles on cheap volatile assets. This is the configuration that turns smallfish
into a golden fish.

### Backtest (validate before going live)

```bash
# Sweep all profiles on the 4 golden assets — no fees (raw signal edge)
smallfish-backtest --symbols ADAUSDT DOGEUSDT XRPUSDT SUIUSDT --days 30 --sweep --interval 5 --equity 50

# Sweep with MEXC fees (the only fee tier that works)
smallfish-backtest --symbols ADAUSDT DOGEUSDT XRPUSDT SUIUSDT --days 30 --sweep --interval 5 --equity 50 --maker-fee 0.0 --taker-fee 0.0001

# Single aggressive backtest on MEXC data
smallfish-backtest --symbol ADAUSDT --days 30 --mode aggressive --interval 5 --equity 50 --exchange mexc

# Quick 7-day validation
smallfish-backtest --symbols ADAUSDT DOGEUSDT --days 7 --mode aggressive --interval 5 --equity 50 --maker-fee 0.0 --taker-fee 0.0001 --chart
```

### Live Trading (MEXC)

```bash
# Conservative first — no testnet on MEXC, so start safe
smallfish --mode conservative --dashboard

# Aggressive with dashboard + Telegram monitoring
smallfish --mode aggressive --dashboard --telegram

# Ultra mode — maximum compounding (high risk)
smallfish --mode ultra --dashboard --telegram

# Full stack: multigrid + dashboard + Telegram
smallfish --mode aggressive --dashboard --multigrid --telegram
```

### Fee Viability Reference

| Exchange | Maker | Taker | Verdict |
|----------|-------|-------|---------|
| **MEXC** | 0.000% | 0.010% | All profiles profitable |
| Near-zero | 0.005% | 0.005% | All profiles profitable |
| VIP1 | 0.010% | 0.035% | All profiles negative |
| Standard | 0.020% | 0.055% | Devastating |
| dYdX | 0.010% | 0.050% | All profiles negative |

### Golden Rules

1. **Only cheap volatile assets**: ADA, DOGE, XRP, SUI — never BTC/ETH (fee ratio too high)
2. **Only 5m candles**: 1m is too noisy for fees, 30m kills signal quality
3. **Only MEXC or near-zero fee exchanges**: anything above 0.01%/side kills the edge
4. **Start conservative**: validate fills and slippage before scaling up
5. **Respect the kill switch**: the market will always be there tomorrow

### Expected Performance (MEXC fees, 7d, 5m, $45 start)

| Profile | Return | Final $ | Win Rate | Profit Factor | Max DD | Trades |
|---------|--------|---------|----------|---------------|--------|--------|

```

> These are backtest results on ~7 days of MEXC 5m data (API returns max 2000 candles per symbol).
> Live performance will be lower due to slippage, partial fills, and latency. Expect 30-50% of
> backtest returns in live trading. With aggressive at 30-50% live efficiency: **$45 → $75-110 in a week**.
>
> **Fee gotcha**: `--taker-fee` is a decimal, not a percentage. MEXC 0.01% = `0.0001`. Using `0.01`
> would mean 1% fee and everything goes negative. Double-check your decimals.
